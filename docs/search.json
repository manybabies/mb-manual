The Governing Board and Executive Director are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. In cases of complaints directly to project leads, Governing Board members, or the Executive Director, the reporter’s identity will be known only to those directly contacted by the complainant, unless the complainant’s explicit permission is obtained.\nGoverning Board members or project leads who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Governing Board or project’s leadership.\nFurther details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.",
