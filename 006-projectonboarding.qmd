# Project Onboarding {#sec-projectonboarding}

> The MB Executive Director will help project leads set up the following resources before project launch:

* **Name**: should be short and informative; use exisiting projects as a guide
* **Logo**: main projects only; spin-offs can use main project logo or request a variant
* **Directory on MB Google Drive**: project leads will be given full access and power to manage access/sharing
* **Listserv**: `mb[proj#]-list@manybabies.org`
* **Contact email**: `mb[proj#]@manybabies.org` (note that this address is set up as a Google Group with a [collaborative inbox](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/10375787?hl=en) for project leads to share)
* **Page on MB website**: `manybabies.org/MB[proj#]`
